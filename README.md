# Mobius DApp Store Go SDK

The Mobius DApp Store JS SDK makes it easy to integrate Mobius DApp Store MOBI payments into any Go application.

A big advantage of the Mobius DApp Store over centralized competitors such as the Apple App Store or Google Play Store is significantly lower fees - currently 0% compared to 30% - for in-app purchases.

## DApp Store Overview

The Mobius DApp Store will be an open-source, non-custodial "wallet" interface for easily sending crypto payments to apps. You can think of the DApp Store like https://stellarterm.com/ or https://www.myetherwallet.com/ but instead of a wallet interface it is an App Store interface.

The DApp Store is non-custodial meaning Mobius never holds the secret key of either the user or developer.

An overview of the DApp Store architecture is:

- Every application holds the private key for the account where it receives MOBI.
- An application specific unique account where a user deposits MOBI for use with the application is generated for each app based on the user's seed phrase.
- When a user opens an app through the DApp Store:
  1) Adds the application's public key as a signer so the application can access the MOBI and
  2) Signs a challenge transaction from the app with its secret key to authenticate that this user owns the account. This prevents a different person from pretending they own the account and spending the MOBI (more below under Authentication).
